# üõ°Ô∏è Splunk SIEM Project

## üîç Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build and operate a fully functional **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution using **Splunk Enterprise**. The goal is to ingest and analyze logs from multiple sources across a simulated enterprise network in order to detect, alert, and visualize real-world attack patterns.

### üí° Why Splunk?

Splunk was chosen because of its:

- Powerful log indexing and search capabilities
- Built-in support for dashboards and visualizations
- Extensive support for log sources (via Universal Forwarder, Syslog, HEC, etc.)
- Ability to integrate with threat detection tools like Wazuh and honeypots like Cowrie

---

## üéØ 2. Objectives

- ‚úÖ Perform **centralized log collection** from multiple systems into Splunk
- ‚úÖ Enable **real-time detection** of brute force, reverse shell, and malicious process execution
- ‚úÖ Build **interactive dashboards** to visualize attack trends and traffic patterns
- ‚úÖ **Simulate real-world attacks** in a controlled lab and observe how logs flow and get correlated across systems

---

## üß∞ 3. Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies were used to build and simulate the Splunk SIEM environment:

### üî∂ SIEM Platform

- **Splunk Enterprise**
  - Version: 9.x
  - Role: Core SIEM platform for log collection, correlation, alerting, and dashboarding

### üîç Intrusion Detection

- **Wazuh HIDS**
  - Role: Host-based intrusion detection system (Linux and Windows agents)
  - Features: File integrity monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerts

- **Sysmon (System Monitor)**
  - Role: Windows endpoint visibility (process creation, network activity, registry changes)

### üß™ Honeypot

- **Cowrie**
  - Role: SSH honeypot to simulate vulnerable Linux systems
  - Captures: Brute-force attempts, commands entered by attackers, session transcripts

### üåê Network & Firewall

- **OPNsense Firewall**
  - Role: Network router and firewall (based on HardenedBSD)
  - Forwards firewall logs to Splunk via Syslog

### üíª Operating Systems

| OS                | Used For                         |

## üö® 6. Alerts Creation in Splunk

Alerts in Splunk are based on saved searches that are **scheduled to run periodically**. When the result of the search meets a specific condition, Splunk triggers a defined **action**, such as sending an email, executing a script, or writing to a log.

---

### üß≠ Steps to Create an Alert

1. **Go to:** `Search & Reporting` app
2. **Run a search** you want to alert on (e.g., successful Cowrie logins)
3. **Click "Save As ‚Üí Alert"**
4. Fill in the following:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Name of the alert (e.g., `Honeypot Successful Login`) |
| **Time range** | How far back Splunk should look (e.g., last 5 minutes) |
| **Trigger condition** | When to trigger (e.g., if result count > 0) |
| **Trigger actions** | Email, log event, webhook, script, etc. |
| **Schedule** | How often to run (e.g., every 5 minutes) |

---

### ‚úÖ Example Alert: Honeypot Successful Login

### üîç Alert Search Query

```spl
index=honeypot sourcetype=cowrie eventid="cowrie.login.success"
| stats count by src_ip, username
```

![wazuh](Screenshots/cowriesuccess.png)


| Field                 | Value                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alert Name**        | Honeypot Successful Login                                       |
| **Schedule**          | Every 5 minutes                                                 |
| **Search Window**     | Last 5 minutes                                                  |
| **Trigger Condition** | If results **exist** (i.e., count > 0)                          |
| **Action**            | Send email to [analyst@example.com](mailto:analyst@example.com) |

### ‚úÖ How to Check If an Alert Was Triggered in Splunk

Splunk provides multiple ways to verify whether an alert has been triggered, depending on how it was configured (real-time vs. scheduled, output actions, etc.).

---

### 1. üîî Use the Alerts Dashboard (Splunk Web)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the `Search & Reporting` app.
2. Click on **Alerts** in the top navigation bar.

**You‚Äôll see a list of:**
- Alert Name

- Trigger Count
- Last Triggered Result
- Status (Enabled/Disabled)

üí° *Click on an alert name to view its detailed configuration and trigger history.*

![wazuh](Screenshots/triggeredalert2.png)

---

### 2. üì¶ Check the Alert Actions (Email, Index Logging, Webhook)

#### üìù Example: Logging to an Index

If your alert was configured to write to an index:

```spl
index=alerts sourcetype=cowrie_alerts
```

This helps verify if the alert was logged internally.

#### ‚úâÔ∏è Example: Email Notification

If the alert was set to send an email:
Check your inbox or SMTP mail logs.
Ensure email settings in Splunk are configured correctly under Settings ‚Üí Server Settings ‚Üí Email settings.

---

### 3. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Search Splunk‚Äôs Internal Logs
   
Splunk records alert executions in the internal scheduler logs.

```spl
index=_internal source=*scheduler.log* savedsearch_name="Honeypot Successful Login"
| table _time savedsearch_name status user
| sort - _time
```

| Field              | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `savedsearch_name` | Name of the alert                             |
| `status`           | Execution result (`success`, `skipped`, etc.) |
| `_time`            | When the alert was triggered                  |
| `user`             | User who owns the saved search                |

| Field         | Value                                 | Explanation                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **eventid**   | `cowrie.session.connect`              | New SSH connection to Cowrie detected.     |
| **src\_ip**   | `192.168.0.104`                       | Attacker's IP address.                     |
| **dst\_ip**   | `192.168.0.103`                       | Honeypot IP address.                       |
| **dst\_port** | `2222`                                | Custom SSH port used by Cowrie.            |
| **system**    | `cowrie.ssh.factory.CowrieSSHFactory` | Cowrie‚Äôs backend handler for SSH sessions. |
| **sensor**    | `kali`                                | Name of system running Cowrie.             |

üîç Security Insight: This log confirms a brute-force or probing attempt against the honeypot. Can be correlated with failed logins or command execution.

### 5. Wazuh Alert Log from Splunk

This Wazuh log shows open ports reported via OSSEC module, parsed into Splunk.

![wazuh](Screenshots/wazuhlogs.png)

| Field       | Value          | Explanation                                             |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **index**   | `wazuh-alerts` | Alerts from Wazuh are sent to this index.               |
| **agent**   | `windows/kali` | The machine where the alert originated.                 |
| **decoder** | `netstat`      | Indicates the log parsed by `netstat` decoder in Wazuh. |

üîç Security Insight: Helps identify services running on critical ports. Can detect new/hidden services indicating backdoors or post-exploitation behavior.

## üß± 9. Challenges Faced

During the setup and integration of multiple components into Splunk, several issues were encountered:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Issues

* ‚ùå **Splunk Universal Forwarder Authentication**: Troubles occurred with token mismatch while forwarding Wazuh data.
* ‚ùå **Cowrie to Splunk (HEC)**: The HEC port had to be manually enabled and configured in Splunk, and SSL verification sometimes blocked test events.

### üì¶ Data Volume Management

* üåÄ Splunk generated a high volume of logs, especially from journald and Wazuh.
* üßπ Needed to tune inputs and limit noisy log sources to keep Splunk responsive.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Field Extraction & Parsing

* üõ†Ô∏è Some logs (e.g., OPNsense) needed extra parsing using add-ons like **TA-pfSense**.
* üõ†Ô∏è Manual field extractions were required in a few JSON-based test files for meaningful dashboards.

---

## üß† 10. Key Learnings

Throughout this project, several technical and analytical skills were developed and reinforced:

### üîç Log Ingestion and Parsing

* Gained hands-on experience ingesting logs from heterogeneous sources (Linux, Windows, Honeypot, Firewall).
* Learned to assign appropriate `sourcetypes`, indexes, and parsing configurations in Splunk.
* Understood the importance of clean field extractions for accurate searching and correlation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Integration

* Successfully set up:

  * **Splunk Universal Forwarder** for agent-based log forwarding (Wazuh, journald).
  * **HTTP Event Collector (HEC)** for forwarding Cowrie honeypot logs.
  * **Syslog over UDP** to receive firewall logs from OPNsense.
* Integrated all logs into Splunk in near real-time for central visibility.

### üìà Security Event Analysis

* Practiced writing **SPL (Search Processing Language)** queries to identify:

  * Brute-force attempts on SSH.
  * Reverse shell execution.
  * Port scan activity.
* Analyzed attack timelines using indexed event data across multiple sources.

### üö® Alerting and Automation

* Created **real-time and scheduled alerts** to notify about security events.
* Configured alert actions:

  * Email notifications
  * Dashboard card triggers
  * Logging to custom index

### üìä Dashboarding and Visualization

* Built dashboards to visualize: Honeypot SSH activity
* Created correlation views showing attacker activity across systems.

### üß© Performance and Optimization

* Understood the impact of **high-volume logging** on Splunk performance.
* Applied:

  * Source filtering
  * Event sampling
  * Index segregation (e.g., `honeypot`, `wazuh`, `opnsense`)
* Tuned Splunk input configurations to maintain efficiency.

## ‚úÖ 11. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated a practical implementation of a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system using **Splunk**. Multiple data sources were integrated, including:

* Wazuh HIDS alerts from Windows and Linux
* Cowrie SSH honeypot logs
* OPNsense firewall syslogs
* Journald system logs

The environment allowed for:

* Simulating **real-world attacks** such as brute-force, reverse shells, and port scans
* Creating **correlated alerts** and **actionable dashboards**
* Performing **event correlation** across multiple layers (host, firewall, honeypot)

Splunk proved to be a powerful platform for security analysis when paired with structured log forwarding, proper field extractions, and thoughtful use cases.
